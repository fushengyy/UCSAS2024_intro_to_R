## What is R?

-   R is a freely available language for statistical computing and graphics 
    (and more).
  
-   First created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in August 1993.

-   Now supported by the R Core Team (formed in 1997) and the R Foundation for 
    Statistical Computing (formed in 2003).

-   Homepage: https://www.r-project.org

-   The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org

-   FAQ: https://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html



## Why R?

> - Open source (free software)

> - Runs on every major operating system

> - Lightweight (compared with commerical software such as MATLAB, SAS)

> - Frequent releases (active development)

> - Fantastic package ecosystem (> 12,000 packages available on CRAN now)

> - Easy to get started (with some programming experience of MATLAB, C++,
    Python, etc.)

> - ...



## What is RStudio?

-   RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

-   It is available in two formats:
    -   **RStudio Desktop**: a regular desktop application;
    -   **RStudio Server**: runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio
        using a web browser.

## Getting Help

The `help()` function and `?` operator in R provide access to the documentation 
pages for R functions, data sets, and other objects.

Example:

To get help with the `mean` function, we can use either

```r
help(mean)
```

or

```r
?mean
```



## Simple Calculations

-   R as a calculator:
    -   `+` Addition
    -   `-` Subtration
    -   `*` Multiplication
    -   `/` Division
    -   `^` or `**` Exponentiation
    -   More [here](https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html)

-   Some built-in functions:
    -   `sqrt()` Square root
    -   `log()` Natural log
    -   More [here](https://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html)




## Assignment Operators

Assign a value to a name using `<-`, `->`, or `=`.

Example:

```r
x <- 5
"Hello World!" -> y
z = 2024
```

-   Difference between `<-`/`->` and `=`:
    -   `<-` and `->` are the traditional assignment operators in R. They are 
        used to assign values to variables.
    -   `=` is also used for assignment, but it's more commonly used within
        function calls to assign values to arguments.



## Data Types

In R, there are 6 basic data types:

-   Logical

-   Numeric

-   Integer

-   Complex

-   Character

-   Raw


## Data Types (cont.)

> -   **Logical**: boolean data type, can have two values: `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

> -   **Numeric**: all real numbers with or without decimal values.

> -   **Integer**: real values without decimal points.

> -   **Complex**: purely imaginary values.

> -   **Character**: character or string values. We can use single quotes `''` 
      or double quotes `""`.

> -   **Raw**: specifies values as raw bytes. This will NOT be discussed in 
      this workshop.



## Data Structures

|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1d | Vector        | List          |
| 2d | Matrix        | Data frame    |
| nd | Array         |               |

-   R does not have scalar types.

-   Almost all other objects are built upon these foundations.

-   `str()` (short for *structure*) gives a compact, human readable description of
    any R data structure.


## Data Structures (cont.)

**Vectors**

A **vector** is a sequence of elements of the same type. This is the simplest 
and most common data structure in R. Vectors can contain numeric, character, 
logical, or other types of elements, but all elements must be of the same type.

-   Some useful operators and functions for atomic vectors:

```r
c(), vector(), length(), names(), setNames()
rep(), rep.int(), rep_len(),
seq(), seq.int(), seq_len(), seq.along(),
%in%, match(), rev(), head(), tail(), paste(), paste0()
typeof(), is.character(), as.character(), is.numeric(), as.numeric()
is.logical(), as.logical(), ...
```


## Data Structures (cont.)

**Matrices and Arrays**

A **matrix** is a two-dimensional, rectangular layout of elements of 
the same type.

An **array** is similar to a matrix but can have more than two dimensions. 
Like a matrix, it holds elements of the same type.

-   Some useful functions and operators:

```r
dim(), ncol(), NCOL(), nrow(), NROW()
names(), colnames(), rownames(), dimnames()
cbind(), rbind()
t(), aperm(), diag(), sweep()
rowSums(), colSums(), rowMeans(), colMeans()
as.matrix(), data.matrix()
crossprod(), tcrossprod(), %*%, %o%, outer()
eigen(), qr(), svd(), rcond(), solve()
```


## Data Structures (cont.)

**Data frames and Lists**

A **data frame** is a table or a 2D array-like structure in which each column 
contains values of one variable, and each row contains one set of values from 
each column. It's similar to a matrix but can contain different types of 
elements.

A **list** is similar to a vector but can contain elements of different types. 
Lists can even contain other lists or vectors, making them highly versatile.


## Data Structures (cont.)

-   Some commonly used functions for data frames and lists:

```r
list(), unlist()
data.frame(), as.data.frame()
names(), colnames(), rownames()
$, [[, [,
length(), head(), tail()
table(), xtabs(), ftable()
with()
expand.grid()
subset()
do.call()
by(), aggregate()
reshape(), merge()
```



## Quiz 1

Consider $x = (7,7,9,6,55,2)$

-   What is the length of this vector?
-   What are unique values of $x$?
-   Sort the values of $x$.
-   Frequency distribution of $x$.



## Quiz 2

How would you describe the following three objects? 

What makes them different to `1:5`?

```r
x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5))
x2 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5, 1))
x3 <- array(1:5, c(5, 1, 1))
```



## Quiz 3

Let $A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ and 
$B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 7 \\ 6 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$.

Find

-   dimensions of $A$ and $B$;
-   determinants of $A$ and $B$;
-   $A+B$;
-   $AB$;
-   $A^{-1}$ and $B^{-1}$.



## Function

-   A function in R is a piece of code that performs a specific task and can 
    be reused throughout your program.

-   Functions help to organize code efficiently, making it more readable and 
    manageable. 

-   They can take inputs (known as arguments), perform operations on these 
    inputs, and return an output.

```r
function_name <- function(arguments) {

    ## do something interesting here

    ## the last expression evaluated will be returned
    ## or explictly use return()

}
```


## Function (cont.)

-   Components:

    -   **Function Name**: the actual name of the function. It is stored in R 
        environment as an object with this name..
    
    -   **Arguments**: arguments or parameters the function takes. 
        Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. 
        Also arguments can have default values.
    
    -   **Function Body**: contains a collection of statements that defines 
        what the function does.
    
    -   **Return Value**: the function can send back a value or result with 
        the `return` statement.



## Quiz 4

Write a function that takes $x$ and $y$ as inputs and returns the value $y^x$.



## Loop

Loops in R are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain 
condition is met. They are handy for automating repetitive tasks and processing 
collections of data (like lists or vectors) one element at a time. 
There are mainly two types of loops in R: `for` loops and `while` loops.



## Loop (cont.)

-   `for` loop: is used to iterate over a sequence (like a vector, list, or a 
    range of numbers) and execute a block of code for each element in 
    that sequence.

```r
for(variable in sequence) {
  # Code to execute for each element in the sequence
}
```

-   `while` loop: continues executing the block of code as long as the specified
    condition is `TRUE`.

```r
while(condition) {
  # Code to execute as long as the condition is true
}
```


## Condition

Conditions in R are used to make decisions in your code based on whether certain
criteria are true or false. They are fundamental to controlling the flow of 
execution in a program, allowing you to perform different actions based on 
different inputs or states of the program.


## Condition (cont.)

-   Basic Conditional: `if`

    The `if` statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition 
    is `TRUE`. 
    
```r
if (condition) {
  # Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```


## Condition (cont.)

- Adding an `else`
    
    To specify an action that should occur when the if condition is not TRUE, 
    you can use an `else` statement:
    
```r
if (condition) {
  # Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  # Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```


## Condition (cont.)

-   Multiple Conditions: `else if`

    For more complex decision-making, you can check multiple conditions 
    sequentially using else if:

```r
if (condition1) {
  # Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  # Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
  # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
}
```



## Quiz 5

Using the conditional statement, check whether -9 is divisible by 2 or by 3.



## Read and Write Data from/to Local Directory

-   Read data syntax:

```r
read.table(file = "location_of_file", header = TRUE)
```

-   Write/Save data syntax:

```r
write.table(dataName, file = "location_of_file")
```

-   Some useful functions:

```r
read.csv(), read.csv2(), write.csv(), write.csv2(), etc.
```



## Install and Load R Packages

-   Install a package syntax:

```r
install.packages("package_name")
```

-   Load a package syntax:

```r
library("package_name")
```

-   Install and load "Lahman" package:

```r
install.packages("Lahman")
library(Lahman)
```

*The ["Lahman" package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/index.html) 
provides the tables from the 'Sean Lahman Baseball Database' as a set of 
R data.frames.*



## Search and Read Datasets in a Package

-   Search datasets from a package syntax:

```r
data(package = "package_name")
```

-   Read a particular dataset from a package syntax:

```r
data("dataName", package = "package_name")
```

-   Search and Read Datasets in "Lahman"

```r
data(package = "Lahman")
data("Batting", package = "Lahman")
```

*The "Batting" table contains historical season-level baseball data for Major
League Baseball from 1871 to 2022.*



## Data Manipulation using Base R

`str(Batting)`: Check variables.

`names(Batting)`: Names of variables in the dataset.

`head(Batting)`: Display the first few rows of the dataset.

`Batting[, 1:4]`: Display the first 4 columns of the dataset.

`Batting[1:4,]`: Display the first 4 rows of the dataset.


## Data Manipulation using Base R (cont.)

`Batting$playerID`: Display values of the variable "playerID".

`Batting[, c("playerID")]`: Display values of the variable "playerID".

`Batting[1:10, c("playerID", "yearID")]`: Display the first 10 elements of the 
variables "playerID" and "yearID".

`Batting$CS_SO <- Batting$CS + Batting$SO`: Create a new variable "CS_SO" by
adding up values of variables "CS" and "SO".

`Batting[, c("CS", "SO", "CS_SO")]`: Display only "CS", "SO", and "CS_SO" of 
the updated dataset.

More base R options check 
[here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/base-r.pdf).



## Quiz 6

Using dataset "Batting"

-   Display data from year 1900 only.

-   Find total number of players played through out all games.

-   Find total number of teams played through out all games.

-   Create a new dataframe "Batting1950" for year 1950 only.



## Data Manipulation using dplyr

`dplyr` is a powerful and popular package in R for data manipulation. 
It provides a set of intuitive functions for processing and transforming data 
frames, making data analysis tasks more straightforward and readable.

-   Installation and loading:

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

-   Some commonly used functions in `dplyr` for data manipulation:

```r
filter(), select(), mutate()
summarise() or summarize()
arrange(), group_by()
```


## Data Manipulation using dplyr (cont.)

-   Load dataset "Salaries" from package "Lahman":

```r
data("Salaries", package = "Lahman")
head(Salaries)
```

-   Create a subset of "Salary" data without league info (variable `lgID`):

```r
salaries <- Salaries %>% select(playerID, yearID, teamID, salary)
```

-   Join salary info and batting info together:

```r
batting <- left_join(Batting, salaries, by = c("playerID", "yearID", "teamID"))
```

*`left_join(a, b, by = "x1")`: Join matching rows from b to a.*


## Data Manipulation using dplyr (cont.)

-   Average salary of all the players and games:

```r
mean(batting$salary, na.rm = TRUE)
```

*`na.rm = TRUE` removes all the `NA` values before the computation proceeds.*

-   Rearrange orders of the dataset by multiple variables:

```r
batting <- batting %>% arrange(playerID, yearID)
```

More dplyr options check 
[here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf).



## Quiz 7

-   Using dataset "Batting" to find players who have a minimum of 25 base on 
balls (variable `BB`) before the year (variable `yearID`) of 1900 and save to 
a new dataframe "player25".

-   Rearrange these players based on base on balls in a descending order and 
save to a new dataframe "player25_ordered".



## Visualization Using Base R

Base R provides a variety of functions for creating data visualizations without 
the need for additional packages. 

-   Scatter Plot

    A scatter plot is useful for visualizing the relationship between two 
    continuous variables.
    
```r
# Sample data
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2

# Create a scatter plot
plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot", xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis", 
     col = "blue", pch = 19)
```

## Visualization Using Base R (cont.)

-   Line Plot
    
    Line plots are useful for showing trends over time or ordered categories.
    
```r
# Create a line plot
plot(x, y, type = "l", main = "Line Plot", xlab = "X-axis", ylab = "Y-axis", 
     col = "red")
```

-   Histogram

    Histograms are great for showing the distribution of a dataset.
    
```r
# Generate random data
data <- rnorm(100)

# Create a histogram
hist(data, main = "Histogram", xlab = "Value", col = "green", border = "white")
```


## Visualization Using Base R (cont.)

-   Bar Plot

    Bar plots are used to compare different groups or categories.
    
```r
# Sample data
categories <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
values <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)

# Create a bar plot
barplot(values, names.arg = categories, main = "Bar Plot", ylab = "Frequency", 
        col = "cyan")
```


## Visualization Using Base R (cont.)

-   Box Plot

    Box plots are used to show the distribution of a dataset and identify 
    outliers.
    
```r
# Generate sample data
set.seed(10)
group1 <- rnorm(100)
group2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 5)

# Create a box plot
boxplot(group1, group2, main = "Box Plot", names = c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 
        col = "orange")
```



## Visualization Using ggplot2

`ggplot2` is a widely-used R package for creating high-quality and customizable 
graphics. It's based on the grammar of graphics, a set of principles for 
creating consistent and comprehensible visualizations. 

-   Installation and loading:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```
-   Prepare the data we want to use:

```r
year_data <- batting %>% filter(yearID == "2005")
```


## Visualization Using ggplot2 (cont.)

-   Scatterplot of Home runs vs. Doubles in 2005

```r
ggplot(year_data, aes(x = X2B, y = HR)) +
  geom_point()
```

```r
# Change label names and add title
ggplot(year_data, aes(x = X2B, y = HR)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Doubles", y = "Home runs", title = "Scatterplot: Home runs vs. Doubles")
```

```r
# Group by League (lgID)
ggplot(year_data, aes(x = X2B, y = HR, color = lgID)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Doubles", y = "Home runs", title = "Scatterplot: Homeruns vs. Doubles")
```


## Visualization Using ggplot2 (cont.)

-   Total home runs by year

```r
totalHR <- Batting %>% 
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(HomeRuns = sum(as.numeric(HR), na.rm=TRUE),
            Games = sum(as.numeric(G), na.rm=TRUE))
```

-   Plot HR by year, pre-1919 (dead ball era)

```r
totalHR %>% filter(yearID <= 1918) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = yearID, y = HomeRuns)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Home runs hit")
```


## Visualization Using ggplot2 (cont.)

-   Take games into account

```r
totalHR %>% filter(yearID <= 1918) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = yearID, y = HomeRuns/Games)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Home runs per game played")
```

-   Widen perspective to all years from 1871

```r
ggplot(totalHR, aes(x = yearID, y = HomeRuns)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Home runs hit")
```


## Visualization Using ggplot2 (cont.)

-   Similar plot for HR per game played by year - 
    shows several eras with spikes in HR hit

```r
ggplot(totalHR, aes(x = yearID, y = HomeRuns/Games)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Home runs per game played")
```
